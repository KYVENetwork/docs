# Filtering a Query

To create more complex queries, you can make use of Filters. A Filter consists of 4 parts:

1. **Field**: The field name you want to filter on. You can use any string. If you are going to filter on a sub-field, use a double underscore to select it.
2. **Value**: A value to filter for. You can use any type for a given field name.
3. **Operator** (optional): Operators allow you to add more selection to your filter.
4. **Combinator** (optional): You can combine multiple filters with a combinator.

## Operators

An operator allows the user to apply a specific operation to filter. Allowed values are:

| Operation   | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALL         | Every item in the list of values provided is in an array       |
| CONTAINS    | String field contains value                                    |
| ENDS_WITH   | String field ends with value                                   |
| EXISTS      | Value for field exists                                         |
| GT          | Greater than                                                   |
| GTE         | Greater than or equal to                                       |
| IN          | Value is in the list (a list of values should be provided)     |
| LT          | Less than                                                      |
| LTE         | Less than or equal to                                          |
| NE          | Not equal to                                                   |
| NIN         | Value is not in the list (a list of values should be provided) |
| REGEX       | String field match by regex                                    |
| SIZE        | The size of the array is                                       |
| STARTS_WITH | String field starts with value                                 |

## Combinator

Possible values are AND and OR. A combinator always combines the previous filter with the current one.

#### Example:

_Select all objects where the field 'hash' starts with “0xa” and the field 'number' is less than 1000_

```
filter: [
    { field: "hash", operator: STARTS_WITH, value: "0xa" }
    { field: "number", operator: LT, value: 1000, combinator: AND }
]
```
