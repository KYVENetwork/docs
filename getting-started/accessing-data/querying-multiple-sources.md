# Querying multiple sources

KYVE allows you to query multiple sources at the same time. This requires you to use a special gateway endpoint. The
gateways have special Union queries which unify different results types, meaning that you have access to all results at
the same time. You filter a union query with the same and settings as a standard query. The source argument The sources
argument lets you select all the sources you want to apply this query. It is required to have at least one source
specified.

Example: Query the first blocks from Moonriver and Avalanche On run the following Query:

```
query FirstBlockOnAvalancheAndMoonriver{
    blocks(
        filter: [{ field: "number", value: 1 }]
        sources: [AVALANCHE, MOONRIVER]
    ) {
    ... on AvalancheBlock {
        hash
        number
        __typename
    }
    ... on MoonriverBlock {
        hash
        number
        __typename
        }
    }
}
```

This will return two objects. One MoonriverBlock and one AvalancheBlock:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "blocks": [
      {
        "hash": "0xdcfce25a3318f7e6ac4d5ae7f9f3644e39b2ad411ef218d04ca65fec4a1bf737",
        "number": 1,
        "__typename": "AvalancheBlock"
      },
      {
        "hash": "0x250a4c3fc44c89a508adb59137a4936b59655288d5eaea33727c6dbed0733d64",
        "number": 1,
        "__typename": "MoonriverBlock"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
