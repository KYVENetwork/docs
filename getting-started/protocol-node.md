# Running a protocol node

The protocol nodes are the backbone of a KYVE pool. They are responsible
for collecting data from a data source, bundling and uploading them to Arweave and verifying it. This enables KYVE
to store any data stream decentralized and permanently.

### Requirements

Wallets

- A [Keplr](https://keplr.app) wallet with $KYVE. (You can claim some [here](https://app.kyve.network/faucet))
- An [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) keyfile with some AR. (You can claim some [here](https://faucet.arweave.net/))

Minimum hardware requirements

- 1vCPU
- 4GB RAM
- 1GB DISK

### Get some $KYVE

Before continuing, make sure that you have the [Keplr](https://keplr.app) wallet installed in your browser. Head over to the [KYVE app](https://app.kyve.network) and make sure to connect your wallet (this automatically adds and switches to the KYVE network).

Go to the faucet tab and claim some tokens via one of three faucets. The wheel is the easiest option.

::: warning
**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that you are on the correct app URL `https://app.kyve.network`
:::

### Choose a pool

Before you can run a protocol node you have to choose a pool you want to join. You can find an overview of all pools
in the KYVE app [here](https://app.kyve.network/). Once you have chosen a pool you have to remember the pool id and the
pool runtime for later. You can find this information right below the pool name once you have clicked on a pool in the overview. In this example we have chosen the first pool with the pool id `0` and the runtime `@kyve/evm`.

### Verify that you can claim a validator slot

Due to a limited number of validator slots in each pool only the nodes with the highest stake can claim
a validator slot. You can only claim a validator slot if you have **more than the minimum staking amount**.

To check the minimum staking amount you can click on the tab `Validators` once you have selected a pool. There you should see something like this:

![minimum stake](/minimum_stake.png)

In this case all validator slots are occupied, but since the minimum staking amount is 300 $KYVE you just need to have more than 300 to claim a slot. If the minimum staking amount is zero you just have to have more than zero $KYVE.

::: warning
**IMPORTANT**: If you don't have more $KYVE than the minimum staking amount you can not continue!
:::

### Run with KYSOR (recommended)

This example will show how to run a protocol node on a linux system on the Moonbeam pool with the pool Id `0`. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/kyve-org/kysor)

**Running nodes with KYSOR has the following benefits:**

- Only use **one** program to run on **every** pool
- Not installing and compiling protocol binaries **manually** for every pool
- Getting the new upgrade binaries during a pool upgrade **automatically** and therefore **don't risk timeout slashes**
- Make running protocol nodes **standardized** and **easier**

#### Installation

Currently, there are no binaries for the KYSOR, therefore it has to be installed and build manually by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyve-org/kysor.git
cd kysor
```

#### Install dependencies

In order to get started run the following in the project root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Setup

General directory structure and important files:

- `src` contains all the source code of KYSOR
- `kysor.conf.ts` is the main config file. It is explained in more detail below
- `secrets` is the directory where your secrets are stored like `arweave.json` and `mnemonic.txt`
- `runtimes` will be autogenerated once you start KYSOR and will contain all binaries structured by runtime and version
- `db` will be autogenerated once you start KYSOR and will contain all caching data for the protocol nodes
- `logs` will be autogenerated once you start KYSOR and will contain all log data for the protocol nodes

In order to setup KYSOR the following secrets need to be added under the `secrets` directory. If this directory does not exist yet create it in project root.

- `arweave.json` this is the Arweave keyfile you need to provide in order to run protocol nodes. This one keyfile will be used for **all** of your protocol nodes
- `mnemonic.txt` this is the file which contains your mnemonic of your validator account. This one mnemonic will be used for **all** of your protocol nodes

After adding the required secrets you can check the `kysor.conf.ts` file. When you initially open it, it should look like this:

```ts
import { IConfig } from './src/faces';

const config: IConfig = {
  // target of the host machine, can be either "linux" or "macos"
  // important for downloading the correct binaries
  hostTarget: 'linux',

  // whether KYSOR should auto download new binaries
  // if set to false, you have to insert the binaries manually
  autoDownload: true,

  // whether KYSOR should verify the checksums of downloaded binaries
  // if autoDownload is false this option can be ignored
  verifyChecksums: true,

  // settings for protocol node
  // notice that mnemonic and keyfile is missing, those need to be files under the secrets directory
  protocolNode: {
    // the ID of the pool you want to join as a validator
    // an overview of all pools can be found here -> https://app.kyve.network
    poolId: 0,

    // the network you want to run on
    // currently only the testnet network "korellia" is available
    network: 'korellia',

    // the amount of $KYVE you want to stake
    // will only get applied if you are not a validator yet
    // once you are a validator you can manage your stake in the KYVE app
    initialStake: 100,

    // the amount of bytes the node can use at max to cache data
    // 1000000000 equals 1 GB which is usually enough
    space: 1000000000,

    // specify verbose logging
    // is often recommended in order to have a more detailed insight
    verbose: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

Since this file is commented and explained in detail the info regarding config properties can be found in this file.
Every time you edit the config file you have to build the project with `yarn build`.

After entering your config like the `poolId` and your `initialStake` and other settings that are required to run a protocol node on a pool you can start KYSOR by running

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

When you see logs like this everything should work fine

### Get the prebuilt binaries

For our case, the prebuilt binaries every operating system can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm/releases) for every operating system. For example on EVM it would be `evm-linux`, `evm-macos`.

In general, you can get the binaries by clicking on the `Become a validator` button and following the steps until you're on the section `Get node binaries`.

![become validator](/become_validator.png)

Once you're there click the button `KYVE node` which should lead you to the github repository.

![protocol binaries](/protocol_binaries.png)

Once you're on releases you can download the latest binary for your operating system. In our case we download the `evm-macos.zip` and unzip it locally.

![protocol binary download](/protocol_binary_download.png)

When you have downloaded and unzipped the binary correctly you can proceed to [how to verify your binary](/getting-started/protocol-node.md#verify-that-your-binary-has-been-built-correctly)

### Manually build the binaries

Since we want to run a protocol node on a `@kyve/evm` runtime pool we have to clone the correct repository. In our
case clone the [EVM repository](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm) and make sure your are on branch `main`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KYVENetwork/evm.git
cd evm
```

Now run the following commands to install dependencies and build the binaries

```bash
yarn install
yarn build:binaries
```

Once the binaries have been build you should see three binaries (one for every operating system) in the `out` directory.

### Verify that your binary has been built correctly

Execute the binary using the following command to see the available options (example is on a MacOS machine)

```bash
./evm-macos --help
```

If everything is set up correctly you should see the following

```
Usage: @kyve/evm [options]

Options:
  --name <string>              The identifier name of the node. [optional, default = auto generated]
  -p, --poolId <number>        The id of the pool you want to run on.
  -m, --mnemonic <string>      Your mnemonic of your account.
  -k, --keyfile <string>       The path to your Arweave keyfile.
  -s, --initialStake <number>  Your initial stake the node should start with. Flag is ignored node is already staked [unit = $KYVE].
  -n, --network <string>       The chain id of the network. [optional, default = korellia] (default: "alpha")
  -sp, --space <number>        The size of disk space in bytes the node is allowed to use. [optional, default = 1000000000 (1 GB)] (default: "1000000000")
  -b, --batchSize <number>     The batch size of fetching items from datasource. For synchronous fetching enter 1. [optional, default = 1]
  --metrics                    Run Prometheus metrics server. [optional, default = false] (default: false)
  -v, --verbose                Run node in verbose mode. [optional, default = false] (default: false)
  --version                    output the version number
  -h, --help                   display help for command
```

### Start your node

To run your node, copy your Arweave keyfile into your working directory and fetch the mnemonic from Keplr.
Here it is important that you enter the correct `--poolId`, your `--mnemonic` and your desired `--initialStake`.
In our case, we initially stake 10,000 $KYVE to ensure that we get a validator slot.

Run the following command with the same binary as above

```bash
./evm-macos --poolId 0 --mnemonic "your mnemonic in here ..." --initialStake 10000 --keyfile ./arweave.json --network korellia
```

If your node has started correctly, it should print some logs like this:

```

```

### Verify node stake

When you look at your node logs you should then see that the node is starting to verify bundles.

After you have successfully staked you should see your address in the Pool validators table.

![verify stake](/verify_stake.png)

Also, you can now manage your stake through the app under `Manage stake`.
