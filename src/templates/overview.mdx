  pool().start_data}{" "}
  ongoing</span>

- **Networks**
  <div>
    {Object.keys(pool().networks).map((key, index) =>
      formatPoolUrl(key, pool().networks[key], index)
    )}
  </div>
- **Source Node Min Hardware Requirements**
  <div>

      <ul key={index}>
        <li>{r}</li>
      </ul>
    ))}
  </div>

## Requirements

Before you can run a protocol validator on any pool, there are some basic requirements that have to be met, ranging from simple hardware specs to owning a certain amount of $KYVE and other currencies.
Make sure you meet the requirements described [here](/run-a-node/protocol-nodes/requirements).

## Goal

<div>{getGoal(pool())}</div>

KSYNC [here](/access-data-sets/ksync).
