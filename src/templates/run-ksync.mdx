KSYNC will provide the snapshot of an Archway Node, which will act as the source for the KYVE protocol validator and is **required**.

## Install {pool().nodeName} node

The {pool().nodeName} binary with the version <code>{pool().binaryVersion}</code> has to be installed. You can

- follow the official installation instructions <a href={pool().installInstructions}>here</a> or
- download the binary directly from <a href={pool().binaryDownload}>here</a>.

:::danger
If you are building from source please use the specified go version in the go.mod file, else there is the danger of receiving vote slashes.

**{goVersion()}**
:::

You can verify the successful installation with

<CodeBlock>
{`./${pool().binaryName} version\n`}
{`${pool().binaryVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

After the successful installation, you need to set up the {pool().binaryName} config. First choose a moniker and initialize everything:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`./${pool().binaryName} init <your-moniker> --chain-id ${pool().chainId}`}
</CodeBlock>

To download and setup the genesis file execute the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{pool().genesisFile.endsWith(".gz") ? `wget -qO- ${pool().genesisFile} | zcat > ~/${pool().configName}/config/genesis.json` : `wget -qO- ${pool().genesisFile} | cat > ~/${pool().configName}/config/genesis.json`}
</CodeBlock>

### Upgrades

To upgrade the <code>{pool().binaryName}</code> binary successfully, it is required to change the used binary manually.
Therefore, just start the KSYNC process with the upgraded <code>{pool().binaryName}</code> binary after it exited automatically.

**Cosmovisor** is not supported yet, but an upgrade handler like this will be added soon.

## Install KSYNC

### Install with Go (recommended)

To install the required version of `ksync`, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/KYVENetwork/ksync/cmd/ksync@latest
```

Run `ksync version` to verify the installation.

### Install from source

You can also install from source by pulling the ksync repository and switching to the correct version and building
as follows:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KYVENetwork/ksync.git
cd ksync
git checkout tags/v1.0.1
make ksync
```

This will build ksync in `/build` directory. Afterwards, you may want to put it into your machine's PATH like
as follows:

```bash
cp build/ksync ~/go/bin/ksync
```

## Start KSYNC

This command is essential for running as a protocol node in a _state-sync_ pool since this will serve the snapshots to the
protocol node. Basically, KSYNC will sync the blocks with _block-sync_ and waits for the ABCI app to create the snapshots,
once created they are exposed over a REST API server which the protocol node can then query.

To start with default settings serve the snapshots with:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`ksync serve-snapshots --binary="/path/to/${pool().binaryName}" --home="/path/to/${pool().configName}" --source="${pool().nodeName.toLowerCase()}"`}
</CodeBlock>

:::caution
You can only run this command when the corresponding KYVE data snapshot-pool has been created.
:::

Once you see that KSYNC is syncing blocks you can open `http://localhost:7878/list_snapshots`. In the beginning it should
return an empty array, but after the first snapshot height is reached (check the interval in the data pool settings) you
should see a first snapshot object in the response.

:::caution
**Software upgrades** of the data source node have to be performed manually. Therefore, you only need to switch the <code>{pool().binaryName}</code> binaries (after the node exited automatically at an upgrade height) in order to restart KSYNC.

### Changing snapshot api server port

You can change the snapshot api server port with the flag `--snapshot-port=<port>`

### Enabling metrics server and manage port

You can enable a metrics server running by default on `http://localhost:8080/metrics` by add the flag `--metrics`.
Furthermore, can you change the port of the metrics server by adding the flag `--metrics-port=<port>`

### Manage pruning

By default, pruning is enabled. That means that all blocks, states and snapshots prior to the snapshot pool height
are automatically, deleted, saving a lot of disk space. If you want to disable it add the flag `--pruning=false`
