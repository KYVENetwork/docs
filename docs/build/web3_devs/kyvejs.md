# kyvejs

`kyvejs` is the main toolbox for developing applications on KYVE. It is a monorepo holding all relevant js projects surrounding the KYVE protocol including all types in typescript (`@kyvejs/types`), a feature rich sdk (`@kyvejs/sdk`), the main protocol validator logic (`@kyvejs/protocol`), a Cosmovisor for KYVE (`@kyvejs/kysor`) and all officially supported integrations.

More information can be found in the README of the project. The repository can be found here: [github.com/KYVENetwork/kyvejs](https://github.com/KYVENetwork/kyvejs)
