## Differences

Because of the nature of each type of validator there are many differences regarding the setup, minimum stake and other requirements. An overview of those differences can be found below:

|                             | Consensus validator                                   | Protocol validator                                |
| --------------------------- |----------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------- |
| Task                        | find consensus on chain state                | find consensus on data validity              |
| Available Slots             | 100                                          | pools x 50                                   |
| Minimum \$KYVE required      | more than lowest validator if slots are full | more than lowest validator if slots are full |
| Min CPU requirements        | 2vCPU                                        | 1vCPU                                        |
| Min RAM requirements        | 16 GB                                        | 2 GB                                         |
| Minimum DISK requirements   | 250 GB                                       | 8 GB                                         |
| Source of rewards           | transaction fees + inflation                 | data pool funds                           |
| Delegation possible         | yes                                          | yes                                          |

| Reasons for slashing        | double signing, being offline                | invalid voting/uploading, being offline      |
| Programming language        | go                                           | typescript                                   |
