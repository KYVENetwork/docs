# Overview

Web3 applications must communicate with your data through common access interfaces like REST or RPC. KYVE's 
Trustless API enables developers to connect their applications to your data within seconds. With a Merkle 
Proof attached, clients can be 100% sure the retrieved data is valid.

The Trustless API serves the validated data for free, thereby making it accessible for everyone. It provides 
the data via well-known endpoints and allows the seamless integration of KYVE data. It's, for example, efficiently 
serving Ethereum blobs without running an Ethereum archival node. KYVE provides both, a deployed endpoint and
instructions to run an own Trustless API to covering a variety of potential usages.

## FAQ

### What makes the API trustless?
Two important hashes are stored on the KYVE chain during the data validation process. Firstly, the hash of the entire
data bundle is stored, which contains a certain amount of data items (e.g. block 1 to 100). In addition, the Merkle root
of a Merkle tree is stored, which is constructed from these data items. This Merkle root enables the Trustless API, as the
integrity of individual data items (e.g. block 40) can also be guaranteed in this way. To achieve this, the Trustless API
extends the actual data item with a proof that contains all the hashes required to calculate the Merkle root. This allows
the data item to be hashed first and the Merkle root to be calculated using the hashes obtained. If this matches the Merkle
root that was stored on-chain, the client can be sure that the data item has been validated by KYVE.

1. The client requests a data item through a deployed Trustless API endpoint (e.g. https://data.service.kyve.network).
2. The Trustless API responds with the data item, the created proof, and the metadata the client needs to get the correct Merkle root (`chain-id`, `pool-id`, `bundle-id`).
3. The client requests the corresponding Merkle root from an independent KYVE node.
4. After computing the Merkle root with the hash of the received data item and the received hashes in the proof by the Trustless API, the client compares it to the Merkle root
stored on-chain. If it's the same, the data item has been validated by KYVE. If it differs, the data item hasn't been validated by KYVE.
