## $KYVE Inflation

Inflation in the blockchain context refers to the process of minting new tokens to incentivize network participation and maintain a balance between supply and demand. It's crucial for ensuring network security, especially in Proof of Stake (PoS) chains, by providing rewards for node operation and allowing new participants to join.

KYVE implements a unique approach to inflation by maintaining a goal bonded ratio of 80%. The goal bonded ratio refers to the target ratio of tokens being staked within a network, regulating the inflation rate: when more tokens are staked, inflation decreases, and when fewer tokens are staked, inflation increases. The inflation rate is capped between min and max parameters. Only governance has the authority to adjust inflation parameters. Furthermore, KYVE's governance can modify inflation rates and introduce mechanisms such as burning transaction fees to prevent excessive inflation, showcasing decentralized control over the network's economic model.

KYVE has also implemented inflation splitting to best balance the two layers. This is a highly advanced concept, you can read more about it [here](/learn/protocol_structure/advanced_concepts/inflation_splitting).
