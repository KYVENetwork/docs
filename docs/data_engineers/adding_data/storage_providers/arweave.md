# Arweave

[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) is a protocol that offers permanent, decentralized storage. The web as
we know it is impermanent and prone to erasure as a strict function of its
centralization. Corollary: hard drives fail, services are taken offline, and information is lost.

The Arweave protocol, on the other hand, is conceived at the base to maximize rates of data
replication across a distributed network of participating resources, alongside a clever endowment structure to ensure the cause in perpetuity. The implications of a permanent, storage-first web are
rangy, no doubt enabling KYVE’s vision.

Because of Arweaves unique feature - Pay
now, store forever - KYVE chose Arweave as a layer 0, laying the foundation for the KYVE Network.
