# Postgres Destination

This page will guide you through setting up an ELT pipeline to fetch data from
a [KYVE data pool](/introduction/architecture.md) and import it into a local `Postgres` database.

## Postgres Setup

In this step, you will deploy a local `Postgres` database using Docker.

1. Run the following command to create a container with the latest Postgres image:

   ```bash
   docker run --name local-psql -v local_psql_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -d postgres
   ```

2. Access the Postgres terminal to set up a database for the pipeline's destination:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it local-psql psql -U postgres
   ```

3. In the Postgres terminal, run the following commands:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE kyvetest;
   ```

   ```sql
   CREATE USER airbyte_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'pass';
   ```

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kyvetest to airbyte_user;
   ```

   ```sql
   \connect kyvetest
   ```

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public to airbyte_user;
   ```

   ```sql
   \quit
   ```

   A database named `kyvetest` has been created and the user `airbyte_user` with password `pass` now
   has read and write access.

4. Install the [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) Postgres management tool, for example with Homebrew:

   ```sh
   brew install --cask pgadmin4
   ```

5. Run pgAdmin and click on "Add New Server". Give it a name, for example `local-psql`, and in the "Connections" tab fill out the fields as follows:

   - **Host name/address**: `localhost`
   - **Maintenance database**: `kyvetest`
   - **Username**: `airbyte_user`
   - **Password**: `pass` (in case you did not modify it in step 3)

## Configure Airbyte

Now you're ready to create the connection in Airbyte (<http://localhost:8000/>).

1. Set up the source.

   In this step you specify the [KYVE pools](https://app.korellia.kyve.network/#/pools) from which you want to retrieve data, identified by **Pool-IDs**.

   You can also specify **Bundle-Start-IDs** for each pool, in order to limit the records that will be retrieved from that pool. In the KYVE app you can find the bundles for each pool, for example [these](https://app.korellia.kyve.network/#/pools/8/bundles) are the bundles for Pool-ID `8`, the Evmos chain.

   For this example we choose to ingest only the Evmos chain.

    - **Source Name**: KYVE
    - **Pool-IDs**: `8`
    - **Bundle-Start-IDs**: `105395`
    - **KYVE-API URL Base**: *This should remain as is*.

   <br></br>

2. Set up the destination.

   Add the parameters of the Postgres DB that you configured [here](#postgres-setup):

   - **Destination type**: Postgres Local
   - **DB Name**: `kyvetest`
   - **User**: `airbyte_user`
   - **Password**: `pass`

   <br></br>
   <img src="/img/elt/airbyte_kyve_dest.jpg" alt="Airbyte set up destination" width="800px;" />

3. Final ELT configuration.

   This is the final step where you can modify the pipeline.

   - In the **Transfer** field, you can set how often the data should sync to the destination. For this example, we set it to `Manual`.
   - In the **Streams** section, you can modify the Namespace, and you can add a Prefix for the data that will be stored.
   - In the **Activate the streams you want to sync** section, you can modify the behavior of the stream in each repetition. For this example, you could set it to `Incremental|Append`, which means that only new records will be stored on each new sync and will be appended in the DB.

   <br></br>

4. Run the initial sync.

   Click **Sync Now**. You can track progress by clicking "Sync Running". Depending on how you configured the source in Step 1 this may take a while.

## View Stored Data

For viewing the retrieved data, open pgAdmin (or any other Postgres management tool that you have installed) and connect to the `kyvetest` database that you created in [Step 3](#postgres-setup).

In the `public` schema, you will find the retrieved records in both raw and normalized formats.

1. Raw format

   <img src="/img/elt/pgAdmin4_raw.jpg" alt="pgAdmin raw data" />

2. Normalized format

   <img src="/img/elt/pgAdmin4_norm.jpg" alt="pgAdmin normalized data" />

That's it! You've successfully created an end-to-end ELT pipeline fetching data from a KYVE data pool and importing it into a local Postgres database.
